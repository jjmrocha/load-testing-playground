Testing With JMeter
===================
(https://jmeter.apache.org/)

Setup
-----

You can download `jmeter` from [apache.org](https://jmeter.apache.org/)
or install using `brew`:

```commandline
brew install jmeter 
```

Content
-------

Two `JMeter` tests plans:
* `jmeter.jmx` - Similar to the approach used for `the Beast` tests; loads data from the same file, then run multiple GET requests and finally deletes all the data 
* `jmeter-alternative.jmx` - Runs multiple parallel requests, each one:
  * Adds a new record using `PUT`
  * Runs multiple (from 1 to 10) sequential `GET` requests 
  * Finally deletes the record using `DELETE` 


Basic Script
------------

Load script:
```commandline
jmeter -t jmeter.jmx
```

You can customize the test by changing the setup:
![alt text](__images__/basic_setup.png "Script setup")

You can see the execution:
![alt text](__images__/basic_summary.png "Execution summary")

And see a graph with the GET results:
![alt text](__images__/basic_graph.png "Graph results")


Alternative Script
------------------

```commandline
jmeter -t jmeter-alternative.jmx
```

You can customize the test by changing the setup:
![alt text](__images__/alt_setup.png "Script setup")

You can see the execution:
![alt text](__images__/alt_summary.png "Execution summary")

And see a graph with the results for all endpoints:
![alt text](__images__/alt_graph.png "Graph results")


Non GUI Execution
-----------------

To run without GUI, you can use the command:
```commandline
jmeter -t <scrip name> -n -l <output file>
```

Example:
```
$ jmeter -t jmeter.jmx -n -l jmeter.out                                                                                    1 â†µ

```


Client-Server
-------------

In case a single machine is unable to simulate enough users to stress the server you can use the client-server approach and control multiple JMeter servers (running remotely) from a single JMeter client.
