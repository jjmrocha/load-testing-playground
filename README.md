Load Testing Playground
=======================

Specs for the Tested Application
--------------------------------

1. The frameworks being tested will implement the following endpoints:
  * `PUT /apps/{app_id}` - With Body: 
    ```
    {"app-id": {app-id}, "name": "{app name}"}
    ```
    
    Response Status:
    - 200 If the `app_id` already exists, in this case the name must be updated
    - 201 If the `app_id` didn't exists, in this case the record should been created
  * `GET /apps/{app_id}`
  
    Response Status:
    - 200 If the `app_id` was found
    - 404 If the `app_id` doesn't exists
    
    Respose Body:
    ```
    {"app-id": {app-id}, "name": "{app name}"}
    ```
  * `DELETE /apps/{app_id}`
  2. The endpoinds should be available on `127.0.0.1:8080`
3. Data must be stored on a `Postgres 12` database


Frameworks
----------

Currently we have the following implementations:
* [Flask](flask) (Python)
* [Spring-boot](spring) (Java)
* [Starlette](starlette) (Python)


Load Testing

### Testing With Beast (https://github.com/jjmrocha/beast)

___Setup___

You can install `the Beast` from [here](https://github.com/jjmrocha/beast/releases)

___Content___

* A CSV file with test data: `apps.csv`
* Requests templates for GET, PUT and DELETE: 
  * `apps_get.yaml`
  * `apps_put.yaml`
  * `apps_delete.yaml`
* Shell scripts to invoke `the Beast`:
  * `beast_put.sh`
  * `beast_delete.sh`
  * `apps_get.yaml` this one allows you to pass the number of requests and the number of concurrent requests

___How to Test___

1. Run script `beast_put.sh` to load data to the database
2. Run script `apps_get.sh` with different number of concurrent requests to check how the app keep up with the load:

    ```commandline
    % ./beast_get.sh 10000 10
    ===== System =====
    Operating System: darwin
    System Architecture: amd64

    ===== Test =====
    Request template: apps_get.yaml
    Sample Data: apps.csv
    Number of requests: 10000
    Number of concurrent requests: 10
    ===== Preparing =====

### Testing With JMeter (https://jmeter.apache.org/)

___Setup___

You can download `jmeter` from [apache.org](https://jmeter.apache.org/)
or install using `brew`:

```commandline
brew install jmeter 
```

___Content___

Two `JMeter` tests plans:
* `jmeter.jmx` - Similar to the approach used for `the Beast` tests; loads data from the same file, then run multiple GET requests and finally deletes all the data 
* `jmeter-alternative.jmx` - Runs multiple parallel requests, each one:
  * Adds a new record using `PUT`
  * Runs multiple (from 1 to 10) sequential `GET` requests 
  * Finally deletes the record using `DELETE` 


___Basic Script___

Load script:
```commandline
jmeter -t jmeter.jmx
```

You can customize the test by changing the setup:
![alt text](__images__/basic_setup.png "Script setup")

You can see the execution:
![alt text](__images__/basic_summary.png "Execution summary")

And see a graph with the GET results:
![alt text](__images__/basic_graph.png "Graph results")


___Alternative Script___

```commandline
jmeter -t jmeter-alternative.jmx
```

You can customize the test by changing the setup:
![alt text](__images__/alt_setup.png "Script setup")

You can see the execution:
![alt text](__images__/alt_summary.png "Execution summary")

And see a graph with the results for all endpoints:
![alt text](__images__/alt_graph.png "Graph results")


___Non GUI Execution___

To run without GUI, you can use the command:
```commandline
jmeter -t <scrip name> -n -l <output file>
```

Example:
```
$ jmeter -t jmeter.jmx -n -l jmeter.out                                                                                    1 â†µ

```


___Client-Server___

In case a single machine is unable to simulate enough users to stress the server you can use the client-server approach and control multiple JMeter servers (running remotely) from a single JMeter client.
